# GCAppTwo
This repository is made to work on improving app two from the winter break assignment

Included in this repository are my R files (server.R, ui.R, and helpers.R), three data files (compensation.csv, fundamentals500.csv, sics500.csv), and an image file called IdealOrganization.
To run smoothly, aka. we don't need to change any code to run on different computers, we all must synchronize our working directories. Open the image file for reference... when I work on the app, my working directory in RStudio is the folder "winterTwo". Inside winterTwo are the three R files, a folder called "Data" with the three .csv's inside.
It is important that you do the same on your computer when you begin to work on your pieces, or else the code that works perdectly on my machine, will return error messages on yours.
