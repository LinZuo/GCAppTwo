# Greener Change App
This repository is made to work on a project for Greener Change, a non profit that aims to provide the public with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) statistics on publicly-traded companies to raise awareness of social equity and sustainability.

Included in this repository are:
R files (server.R, ui.R, and helpers.R);
three data files (compensation.csv, fundamentals500.csv, sics500.csv)
